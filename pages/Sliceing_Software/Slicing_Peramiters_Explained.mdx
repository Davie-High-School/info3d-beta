## My personal recomendations using my prefered slicer Orca slicer
</Callout>




## Quality
---
[]  Later height: 0.2mm
[]  First Layer height 0.2mm

### Line width
---
[] In moust cases I update these to 0.6mm this is 120% of the nozzle size and can reduce printtime and increase strength. 
[] For detail and text I leave the default settings. 

### Seam position
---
[] Aligned / Rear
[] Scarf joint on all seams. 

### Wall Generator
---
[] Archane 

### Walls and surfaces 
---
[] Inner/Outer/Inner
[] Small area flow compensation(beta) 

### Bridging 
---
[] Thick external bridges 
[] Thick internal bridges 
[] Extra bridge layers(beta) 

Bridge counterbore holes
- [] Sacrificial layer 
    > also helps with support removal.

### Overhangs
---
[] Extra perimeters on overhangs. 


## Strength 
---
### Wall Loops:
---  
> I increase this for desired strength.
[] Wall Loops : 3
[] Alternate Extra Walls


### Top/bottom shells
[] Top shelly layers: 5
[] Top shell thickness: 0mm (
> this dissables the thicknes limmet and uses he number of layers instead. 5 0.2mm layers = 1mm thick) 
[] Top surface pattern: Monotonic Line 
> Depending on the model and desired top surface finish. These can be interesting to play with. 
[] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line
[] Bottom shell thickness: 0mm
> this dissables the thicknes limmet and uses he number of layers instead. 5 0.2mm layers = 1mm thick) 
[] Bottom surface pattern: Monotonic Line 

### Infill 
---
[] Sparse infill density: 10%
> again depending on desired strength. the majority of model strength is derived from the wall not the infill.

[] Sparse infill pattern: Gyroid
> Personal: use for most models, light weight and quick models use adaptive cubic.

[] Infill combination

### Supports 
---
See dedicated section on supports.

### Others 
---
[]Brim type: Mouse ear (if needed)
> this places small tabs on sections of a print that may lif due to internal tension. These are very easy to remove. 

[] Verbose Gcode
[] Label objects
[] Exclude objects
> if the printer supports the feature
