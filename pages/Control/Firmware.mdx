# Firmeware

3d printer use micontrolers to send individual movment commands to motors.


The resulting motion is a movment in the X Y Z and E (extrusion) axies 

There are 3 main Firmwares that manage these commands
> there are several maufacturer specefic such as Bambu but most function very semilar.All listed are opensource

## [RepRap](https://configtool.reprapfirmware.org/)
- ![ReoRap Firmware.webp](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JamesD3d/info3dimages@main/i/Printers/ReoRap%20Firmware.webp)

- Primarialy uses Duet controlboards
- All settings controlled via G-Code
- Uses the RipRap configurator
- Web Based Control Interface

## [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/)
- ![Marlin.webp](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/JamesD3d/info3dimages@main/i/Printers/Marlin.webp)

- Used on multipul boards
- Uses VSCode and the Platform IO extension to build firmware based on config.h and configadv.h files
- Has pre determined setting for most cotrollers and situations. [(Config Referances)](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations/tree/import-2.1.x/config/examples)


## [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)
- Klipper uses a seperate mcu such as a raspberry pi to process and send commands to the micro controller
- Configuration based on a printer.cfg file [(Config Examples)](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/tree/master/config)
- A seperate configuration in needed for the serial id of the micro controller in the moonraker.cfg file
- Web based Interface
- Can support multiple controllers 
> [Kiauh](https://github.com/dw-0/kiauh) is useful tool to install this firmware)
