# FDM 3D Printing Physical Limmitiations

<Callout tpye="info">
All 3d Printed model only retain ~ 40% strength in the Z axis due to layer adheasion
</Callout>

## Curved Surfaces on the Z axis aka "Salmon Skin"
Causes: 
- Just like slicing an apple and putting those slicecs back together. FDM printing builds objects by layering platic at set heights. Continuious curved surfaces are problimatic in the Z axis. 

Solutions: 
- Using Adaptive Layer Heights 
- Chanfers not Fillets on bottom layers.

## Overhangs 

Cause: 
- Gravity + Molten Plastic

Solutions:
- 3d Printer Supports (see section of supports)
- Ensure the Modle has no overhang greater than 45 degrees 

EXAMPLE:

## Printing in Thin Air


Cause:
- Gravity, Model has a region that is floating. 

Soultin:
- If THis is nessessary the only solution is to use supports.
