| [Soldering Iron](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=soldering+iron&crid=1Q2X6Z0J4K8YH&sprefix=de+bur+tool%2Caps%2C123&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) | - a tool is typically used to metl and fuse 3d Printed parts together to to install heatset threaded inserts into parts. |
| [Heat Gun](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=heat+gun&crid=1Q2X6Z0J4K8YH&sprefix=de+bur+tool%2Caps%2C123&ref=nb_sb_noss_1) | - a tool is used to soften and reshape 3D printed parts, especially useful for ABS or PETG materials. It can also be used to remove supports or smooth out surfaces. |
| [Heatset Threaded Inserts](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=heatset+insert&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | - metal inserts that can be melted into 3D printed parts to create strong, threaded holes for screws or bolts. They are particularly useful for parts that will be assembled or disassembled frequently. |
| [Verious Metric Screws and Bolts](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=metric+screws&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | - used to fasten 3D printed parts together or to attach components like motors, electronics, or other hardware. Having a variety of sizes on hand can be helpful for different projects. |
| [Small Wire Cutters](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=wire+cutters&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | - a tool use trim excess material from 3D printed parts or to cut filiment. |
| [A set of metric allen wrenches](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=metric+allen+wrench+set&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | - the majority of 3d printers use metric allen wrenches to assemble and maintain the printer. Having a set of these on hand can be very helpful for making adjustments or repairs. |
| [Nozzle Block Cleaning Tool](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=nozzle+cleaning+tool&crid=2LIHK2QYVEI8Q&sprefix=heatse%2Caps%2C110&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_6) | - a tool used to clean the nozzle of a 3D printer. It can help remove clogs or debris that may affect print quality. - these are based on acupuncture needles and are used to clean the nozzle of a 3D printer. They can help remove clogs or debris that may affect print quality and are extreamly sharp. |
