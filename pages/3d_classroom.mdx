# Education Recomendations for 3D Printing in the Classroom

3d Printing is an exciting technology that appears to be ver enguaging to students of many ages. 
when establishint a 3D printing program in the classroom it is important to consider the following:

## Time:
 - Depending on the printer most object of a small to medium size can take between 20 min - 2 hrs.
 - This is dependent on the over all size, amount of supports, number of walls and infill precentage. 


 ### In a hypithetical senerio an instructor with a class of 20 students to design and priint a small model using tinkercad. The project amount of time needed for each student to complete their design and printing could range from 6 to 20 hours.
 if this instructor has 2 of these classes its evident that the amount of time needed is extensive. 

<Steps>
### Step 1
 - Recomendations: Idealy an instructor woould have access to multipul printers. A ratio of 5:1 is a good balance beetween the number of students and the number of devices needed to mangage. 

### Step 2
- Limmet the size and scope of the students models with design restrictions. Apropriate limmitations and design restictions can greatly improve the sucess of the project. 

### Step 3
- Depened on the size of the printer and the models size and area needed for supports, attempt to put more than one model on the print bed. This can decrease the amout of time between model compleation. This will increase the time need to complete a job. This will also insrease the chance of a failure. 

## Model Managment
- With a large nuber of models to mannage per class it is important to have a system to track what has and hasn't been completed. 

<Callout type="default">
  The Windows app [3D Viewer](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nblggh42ths?hl=en-US&gl=US) is a great tool to view 3D models in the file explorer preview pannel.

<Steps>
### Step 1
- To manage my classroom projects I selected google forms. This was a simple form that recoreded the students email address, class period, grade level, and does not allw students to submit the incorrect file format. 

### Step 2
- Ensure that students label their downloaded model files with their name and class period.
### Step 3
- Ensure that the file size limmet is increased to allow for larger files. 

### Step 4
- Add a check box coloum before the students email address. 
> many districts have the option to convert student emails to "cards" with a friendly name. 

### Step 5
- When you bengin to print the student .stl files you may choose to download individual files via the link provided in google sheets, or you may download all the files at once by downloading a .zip file of the google folder associated with the form. 

### Step 6
- Once all the files are downloaded with in slicers like bambu studio or Orca slicer you can load all the models at once. The slicer can auto arrainge all the classes models into an effchient layout. arrangment on multiplebuild plates. The files can then be sliced and printed in sequience. 

### Step 7
- Remove supports and clean up the models as needed.
<Callout type="warning">
  I would not allow students to remove supports. Small piece of plastic may break off viloently and cause injury. I would recomend eye protection when removing supports.

  These are my personal recomendations based on my experience as a professional 3D techniciions, middle / high school instructor, designer, and maker.

### [Bambu Labs 3d printers](https://us.store.bambulab.com/)
-Rational:
<Steps>
### Step 1
#### Quality of Life
-The majority of the functions setup and calabration of the printer is automated increasing print quality reliability and ease of use.
> including: bed leveling, pressure advace, flow rate, resonance compensation, motor noise canselation, acceleration.

### Step 2
#### Intigrated slicer
- Bambu Studio is an open sourse slicer with well tuned printing profiles for all the bambu printers.

### Step 3
#### Remote Managment
- Bambu Printer are managed via a web interface built into their slicer. This allow to set w veriety of filiment peramiters, trigger clabrations as well as start, pause and monitor prints in progress 

<Callout type="important">
  remote connectionand monitoring is available with the Bambu Studio mobile app and from within the slicer. All printers require wifi internet access for these features to functions
</Callout>

> these are not unique features to Bambu printers however this is a very well intigrated full stack solution that is easy to use and has a large community of users.
